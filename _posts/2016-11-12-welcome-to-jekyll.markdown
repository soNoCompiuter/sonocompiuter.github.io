Hey guys, welcome to my project to be a better developer!  Here, I will try to make some codes and to learn more about program.

I'm a full stack developer (or wanna be). My focus here is contribute to the projects and make some posts of interesting contents. This contents can be some technology, language program, some [Angular JS][angular-js] curiosity, algoritm complexity or anything else.

Probably my next post will be about [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] because this is obvious, this is the framework how I build 
this blog.

So, I'll see you in the next posts.
